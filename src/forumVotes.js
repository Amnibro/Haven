/**
 * Votes on forum topics (#5742), kept out of database.js, which is already
 * past its size budget.
 *
 * channels.forum_votes is the per-forum switch: 0 off (the default),
 * 1 likes, 2 likes and dislikes. forum_votes holds one row per person per
 * topic, value 1 for a like and -1 for a dislike; taking a vote back deletes
 * the row. In a blog forum each picture of a post is its own message (the
 * topic, or one of its author's additions), so picture votes (#5784) are
 * rows here too, keyed by that message. Rows go with their topic or their voter through the cascades.
 * Turning votes off hides them without deleting any, so turning them back
 * on brings the counts back.
